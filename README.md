Iâ€™m happy to share the Cyber Mart - Online Spare Parts Management System project I worked on. 
This project was completed as a group effort during my second year, first semester at SLIIT. We developed an online spare parts management system. The frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while Java and MySQL were used for the backend with Tomcat 9 as the server.

My primary contribution was implementing the payment functionality. As a beginner in web development, I mastered several skills:

Frontend Development:
HTML proficiency: Designed the layout and form structure for the payment page, including input fields, labels, and buttons.
CSS mastery: Created a clean and user-friendly interface with attention to color schemes and responsive design.
JavaScript implementation: Enhanced user interaction by adding validation features for the payment form.
Backend Development:
Java programming: Used JSP and Servlets to handle payment form submissions, database interactions, and session management.
MySQL database management: Designed and implemented a database schema to store user payment information securely.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts:
Encapsulation: I used private fields in classes like Payment and created getter and setter methods to provide controlled access to the data, ensuring better data security and integrity.
Inheritance: In my code, I created a structure where common functionalities could be extended to different types of users, making the code more modular and reusable.
Abstraction: By using service classes like paymentService, I abstracted the payment processing logic from the rest of the application, allowing easier maintenance and scalability.
Polymorphism: I applied polymorphism in handling different types of requests for payment processing, allowing the system to handle various scenarios with the same interface.
Additional Competencies:
Security practices: Ensured data security by using safe input handling and secure storage techniques.
Problem-solving: Addressed challenges like form validation, data handling, and ensuring smooth transactions.
Team collaboration: Contributed to a group effort while enhancing my knowledge in full-stack web development.
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in building web applications, implementing OOP principles, and integrating secure payment systems.
